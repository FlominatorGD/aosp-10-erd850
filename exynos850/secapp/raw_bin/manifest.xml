        <!--

        list with up to 16 different UUIDs, which allows the OEM to restrict a
        certain key to a limited number of UUIDs. To make use of this list,
        define a key without the ALLOW_ANY_UUID flag.

        <uuid value="b230723bcfe75f8581122dc1f8e52f4d"/>

    <key-list>
        <!--

        list with up to 32 different hashes:

        <key filename=... flags=.../>
        <key hash=... flags=.../>

        Attributes:
        "filename": is a path to a PEM file, where the hash will be generated over
                        the public key
        "hash":     a hexadecimal byte string of the form "xxxx...xx", length is 64
                        chars, each char must be [0-9,A-F,a-f]

        "flags": case insensitive comma separated list of
            "ALLOW_DRIVER",                # This key signs drivers
            "ALLOW_MIDDLEWARE",            # This key signs middle ware
            "ALLOW_SYSTEM_TA"              # This key signs system TA
            "ALLOW_ANY_UUID"               # This key signs any UUID, otherwise UUID must be in <oem-reserved-uuid-list>
            "OEM_ID"
            "OEM_FLAG_0" - "OEM_FLAG_7"

        Either "hash" or "filename" should be used. If both attributes present,
        "hash" must match the hash generated from the PEM file. If not, the
        program will abort with an error. This can be used as a fail-safe check
        to ensure the correct PEM file is used and there is a key pair for a
        hash.
